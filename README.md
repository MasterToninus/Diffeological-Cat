# Category of Diffeological Spaces

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for notes and materials prepared for a reading lecture on the **Category of Diffeological Spaces**. The lecture explores diffeological spaces as a generalized framework for smooth geometry and their categorical properties, particularly their interpretation as concrete sheaves on a concrete site.

## Abstract

Diffeological spaces generalize smooth manifolds, providing a robust framework for studying "generalized spaces." A diffeological space consists of a set \( X \) equipped with a collection of "plots"—smooth maps from open subsets of Euclidean spaces into \( X \)—that satisfy three basic axioms. While individual diffeological spaces may exhibit geometric pathologies absent in smooth manifolds, the category \( \mathbf{Diff} \) of all diffeological spaces possesses numerous desirable categorical properties that the category of smooth manifolds lacks.

The notes include a concise introduction to diffeological spaces, the concept of a concrete site, and concrete sheaves. They demonstrate that \( \mathbf{Diff} \) can be identified as a category of "concrete sheaves on a concrete site," making it an archetypal example of a "generalized space." The notes also detail structural properties of this class of categories, emphasizing that any category of concrete sheaves on a concrete site—including \( \mathbf{Diff} \)—is a quasitopos, with all limits and colimits.
